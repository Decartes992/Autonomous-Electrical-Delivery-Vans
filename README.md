# Autonomous-Electrical-Delivery-Vans
**Autonomous Electric Delivery Vans (AEDVs)** Project: Develop software for AEDVs to navigate city grids, handle dynamic changes, and manage pickups/deliveries. Features include real-time updates, accident recovery, and battery charging. Emulate multiple AEDVs on a city map. Deadline: 10 Dec 2023. Dalhousie ECED 3401 Systems Analysis Project. **Authors**: Iftekhar Rafi and William Thornton

## ðŸŒ† Project Overview

In the bustling cityscapes of the modern world, efficient and sustainable delivery mechanisms are paramount. The AEDVs, designed to operate seamlessly in compact city environments, are equipped with a robust 150kWh battery and can carry a staggering payload of up to 2 tonnes. This project's software component is the brain behind these mechanical marvels, ensuring they navigate the dynamic urban maze with precision and efficiency.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### 1. **Dynamic City Navigation**
   - Navigate through intricate city grids.
   - Real-time route optimization to ensure the shortest and most energy-efficient paths.
   - Adapt to dynamic city changes, including traffic, construction zones, and more.

### 2. **Intelligent Pickup & Delivery Management**
   - Automated scheduling and route planning for pickups and deliveries.
   - Dynamic billing system based on weight, distance, and energy consumption.
   - Real-time tracking and status updates for all deliveries.

### 3. **Energy Management & Charging**
   - Monitor battery levels in real-time.
   - Direct AEDVs to the nearest proprietary super-fast charging stations when nearing depletion.
   - Optimize charging schedules to ensure minimal downtime.

### 4. **Safety & Accident Recovery**
   - Advanced collision avoidance algorithms to minimize accidents.
   - In the rare event of an accident, ensure swift recovery and minimal disruption.
   - Continuous monitoring and reporting of AEDV health metrics.

### 5. **Real-time Emulation & Visualization**
   - Emulate the operation of any number of AEDVs on an interactive city map.
   - Visualize routes, charging stations, and other key metrics in real-time.
   - Useful for testing, debugging, and stakeholder demonstrations.
